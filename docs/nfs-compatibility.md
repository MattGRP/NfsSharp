# NFS Compatibility

NfsSharp provides managed NFS protocol and client APIs for .NET. NFSv3 over TCP is the primary target. NFSv4.0, NFSv4.1, and NFSv4.2 APIs are experimental and do not yet carry the same compatibility guarantees.

See the [roadmap](roadmap.md) for delivery order and the [GitHub milestones](https://github.com/GaTTGeng/NfsSharp/milestones) for live progress.

## Compatibility Contract

NfsSharp considers a behavior supported when it:

- works through a documented managed API;
- is covered by a focused automated test;
- is exercised against a real server when the behavior depends on interoperability;
- behaves consistently across supported .NET targets;
- matches the relevant NFS, XDR, and ONC RPC semantics for results, state, and failures.

An implemented method without real-server verification remains partial or experimental.

## Status Legend

| Status | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| **Supported** | Covered for the stated environment with no known major semantic gap. |
| **Partial** | A useful implementation exists, but integration or edge-case coverage is incomplete. |
| **Experimental** | Public surface exists, but behavior and API stability need substantial validation. |
| **Planned** | Work is accepted into the roadmap but is not yet implemented or verified. |
| **Research** | The correct compatibility or SDK contract must be validated before implementation. |

## NFSv3 Behavior Matrix

| Protocol area | NfsSharp API | Status | Track | Remaining work |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Export discovery | `NfsV3Client.ListExportsAsync`, `NfsClient.GetExportedDevicesAsync` | **Partial** | M1/M2 | Real-server coverage, group parsing, empty lists, denial, and portmapper variations. |
| Mount and unmount | `NfsV3Client.ConnectAsync`, `NfsV3Client.UnmountAsync` | **Partial** | M1/M2/M3 | Lifecycle tests, cleanup after failures, reconnect behavior, and server restart cases. |
| Path lookup and attributes | `LookupPathAsync`, `GetAttributesAsync` | **Partial** | M1/M2 | Verified on the repository NFS-Ganesha server for root, nested, missing, file, directory, and symbolic-link paths, including handle/path attribute consistency, mode, size, file identifiers, timestamps, traversal rejection, and `NOENT`/`NOTDIR` status preservation. Remaining work: stale handles, broader timestamp precision behavior, and cross-server attribute fidelity. |
| Access checks and links | `AccessAsync`, `ReadLinkAsync`, link creation APIs | **Partial** | M1/M2 | Verified on the repository NFS-Ganesha server for file and directory ACCESS masks, symbolic-link target reads, hard-link identity, and restricted-directory denial when mode bits are enforced. Remaining work: server policy differences, link limits, symlink loops, and broader error mapping. |
| Directory enumeration | `ReadDirAsync`, `ReadDirPlusAsync` | **Partial** | M1/M2/M3 | Verified on the repository NFS-Ganesha server for empty, small, nested, and multi-page directories, including `READDIRPLUS` attributes and handles. Remaining work: mutation during enumeration, larger cross-server directories, and fault recovery. |
| File reads | `ReadAtAsync`, `ReadFileAsync` | **Partial** | M1/M2/M3 | Verified on the repository NFS-Ganesha server for empty, small, unaligned, boundary-offset, and multi-chunk reads, including EOF reporting, streamed byte fidelity, advertised read-size inspection, configured read chunks, cancellation, invalid handles, and missing paths. Remaining work: larger cross-server files, retry recovery, and server-specific short-read behavior. |
| File writes and commit | `WriteAtAsync`, `WriteFileAsync`, `CommitAsync` | **Partial** | M1/M2/M3 | Partial writes, verifier changes, stability modes, retries, commit ranges, and recovery. |
| Create and remove | `CreateFileAsync`, `CreateDirectoryAsync`, deletion APIs | **Partial** | M1/M2 | Verified on the repository NFS-Ganesha server for file and directory creation with resulting type/mode attributes, file deletion, empty-directory deletion, non-empty-directory `NOTEMPTY`, and recursive directory cleanup. Remaining work: races, stale handles, and broader server-specific failures. |
| Rename and links | `MoveAsync`, `CreateSymLinkAsync`, `CreateHardLinkAsync` | **Partial** | M1/M2 | Verified on the repository NFS-Ganesha server for same-directory rename, cross-directory rename, invalid target parent `NOTDIR`, symbolic-link target preservation, and hard-link identity/content survival after original removal. Replacement rename is covered, with the repository MEM server currently returning `IO` and preserving both files instead of replacing the target. Remaining work: cross-filesystem errors, symlink loops, link-limit failures, races, and broader server policy differences. |
| Attribute mutation | `SetAttributesAsync`, `ChmodAsync`, `ChownAsync`, `UtimesAsync`, `SetFileSizeAsync` | **Partial** | M1/M2 | Guard checks, timestamp precision, identity mapping, truncation, and permission failures. |
| File-system capabilities | `GetFileSystemStatAsync`, `GetFileSystemInfoAsync`, `GetPathConfAsync` | **Partial** | M1/M2 | Verified on the repository NFS-Ganesha server for path and file-handle overloads, FSSTAT capacity/file-count invariants including zero-valued unavailable MEM FSAL fields, FSINFO transfer-size, maximum-file-size, time-delta, and property flags, plus PATHCONF name limits, zero-valued unavailable link limits, and case behavior. Remaining work: additional unavailable/server-specific fields, broader overflow boundaries, and cross-server matrix coverage. |
| Timeouts and retries | `NfsClientOptions` | **Partial** | M3 | Deterministic fault injection, cancellation precedence, duplicate request safety, and backoff policy. |
| Directory cache | `NfsClientOptions.EnableDirectoryCache` | **Partial** | M3 | Invalidation semantics, mutation coherence, expiry races, and concurrency coverage. |

## NFSv4 Boundary

`NfsV4Client` exposes direct COMPOUND-oriented APIs and selected convenience operations. These APIs are experimental because the current automated suite does not validate server interoperability, state recovery, lease behavior, replay handling, callbacks, or a broad security matrix.

The high-level `NfsClient` facade intentionally remains NFSv3-only until NFSv4 lifecycle and recovery guarantees are strong enough to define a stable abstraction.

## Verification Approach

Compatibility work should use the smallest useful test:

1. Unit tests for XDR encoding, decoding, validation, status mapping, and deterministic helpers.
2. Protocol fixture tests for RPC requests and responses, including malformed and boundary payloads.
3. Real-server integration tests for observable NFS behavior and lifecycle.
4. Fault-injection tests for timeout, disconnect, retry, restart, stale-handle, and partial-I/O behavior.
5. A documented server matrix for behavior known to vary across implementations.

Packet normalization may remove transport identifiers or other non-semantic values. It must not hide procedure arguments, status codes, attributes, verifier changes, or ordering that callers can observe.

## Reporting a Gap

[Open an NFS compatibility issue](https://github.com/GaTTGeng/NfsSharp/issues/new?template=nfs_compatibility_gap.yml) and include:

- NfsSharp package and version;
- NFS protocol version and authentication mode;
- server implementation and version;
- the smallest code and server setup that reproduce the behavior;
- expected or reference behavior and actual NfsSharp behavior;
- sanitized logs, packet traces, or RFC references when available.
